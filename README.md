# RedDress-PlantUML
Stylesheets for PlantUML: PlantUML is pretty versatile and frankly speaking, awesome piece of software, but it has huge problem: **it's ugly!**

Maroon and light-yellow styled graphs look so ancient.

This is my attempt to upgrate the experience: starting with dark-blue skin, and more to come.
